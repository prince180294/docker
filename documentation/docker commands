Creating Images:

images can be created by 2 ways:
1. committing containers
2. Dockerfile

Step1 :	committing containers:

check all container present in your system.
docker ps -a
if there are no containers present in your system then you can pull image 
from docker registry and run that image to make a container
for eg:
#docker run centos:latest

then check for available containers using: 
#docker ps -a

not down containerid as it will used for creating your very own ubuntu image
use command : 
#docker commit containerid

above command will create a image which you can check by running command:
#docker images

currently this image has no name, only image id is present. use "tag" command as shown below to name container

#docker tag imageid centos:v1
 
now run your conatiner using command to make a container of your image:
#docker run centos:v1


note:
we can add various parameters during command execution to define properties of container. refer docker documentation for more info:


Step2.  Dockerfile:

dockerfile is most commonly used method for creating images. we define 
various specifications in our docker to define properties of resulting image.
for eg:

#vi dockerfile
FROM centos
WORKDIR /app
COPY /home/user/app .
RUN yum update -y

from: will help in pulling centos image
workdir: set our current working directory
copy : copies our files from docker host to docker image
RUN : run terminal commands to install packages.
save above file and run command docker build to build dockerfile
#docker build dockerfile
#docker images

you will see docker image is created with docker file. now follow same steps to name the image as followed in step1
